				<h3>Middle Business Analyst</h3>
				<p>

					Good evening) At the moment I am a Middle Business Analyst at eWave. Now, in the role of BA, I lead several foreign projects (Australia, America), I help a little at the stage of pre-sales (we analyze new projects and test them), and I

					I am one of the business analysts who runs the in-house school of junior business analysts. (We tell new guys about the company, BA work, teach basic BA skills, as well as the specifics of work in the company). To be honest, I really enjoy my work, although sometimes there are difficult and stressful days. I don't know if this is necessary, but usually my day is structured as follows (communication with a client (Australia), working with a team, writing analytical documents, working in a BA school, communicating with a client (America)). And so in a circle, of course, not all days are the same, but the activity that is constantly there is communication with the client and the team.

					In fact, the UIR gave me a base that allowed me to successfully enroll in courses (yes, to get into BA courses, I had to pass an interview)

					and, of course, an IT base is necessary at work

					It helped a lot that the academy gave me an understanding of such points as: programming, databases, IP design and the concept of IP in general, taught me to model processes. Many of this is not taught in courses, but knowledge of this is necessary in the work, because the work of a BA is not just a conversation with a client - it is also the ability to offer a solution to a client from a technical point of view, write a technical specification for developers, and give the client advice on technical aspects. All this is very important) It is also worth noting that we were given IT English at the Academy) it also helped me a lot, since I do not have a single Russian-speaking client, and I need to communicate a lot) To start work, I had enough knowledge of English - well, then , as they say, we learn at work.

					Also, we had a few humanities subjects at the academy. When we studied, I did not understand why I needed them and what I generally do with these pairs, for example, in psychology or sociology. As a result, these subjects also turned out to be very useful, because when you work in a team with different people, everyone has their own character, worldview, you need to be able to understand everyone, adapt, and unite the team. You also need to understand the cultural characteristics when communicating with a client, be able to properly conduct a dialogue with him in any situation: be it pleasant things or moments when you need to defend your team.

					Do you like the Academy?<br> The general impression is this: I have never regretted that I studied at this university. I came to study on the advice of a relative, who also graduated from UIR. Also

					before admission, I wrote to students on Vkontakte, I found out their feedback, I never received a bad response from them 2.What are its advantages - a very good place, a lot of budget places (at least in the year of our recruitment it was), the scholarship is higher than in other universities, class teachers in all specialties, its own sports complex, the academy meets halfway to people who find themselves places for practice / distribution, any teacher can help with writing a term paper / diploma, even if he does not supervise you, 1 change of training was very helpful 3 what are the advantages of our specialty - cool teachers both in knowledge and in human relations (they let them go to work, were allowed to come to take laboratory tests with other groups), a good technical base, subjects not from any one specific area, which makes it possible to choose the future professions, English 3 years (super useful for IT people), good educational program 4.how did your studies at the academy affect your future place of work (where and by whom do you work now) - almost from the very beginning of the training, the teachers told where the graduates go, what specialties are relevant (mainly IT areas), how people are actively moving up the career ladders, going abroad, etc. Also, many are aware of which companies offer which courses, where to go for training, in general they can give good advice based on their experience. I now work as a test engineer in an IT company, I have been working since the 5th semester, I am engaged in manual and automated testing. Why did you join the testers? Initially, I wanted IT, but to start from the very bottom, to find out how everything works, it works, because you can grow and change activities (for programming, BA, design) without any problems. Also, many graduates of the academy go to testing, since enough technical knowledge is given in the Academy to be better than graduates of foreign languages, etc., who usually also work as testers. I didn't want to start programming right away, since we have very little of it at the Academy, and, in principle, the training plan for the direction is not right.

				<h3>Director of Business Development</h3>
				<p>
					- Tell us about your work at the moment?<br> I am the Director of Business Development at Blinger.io. For 4 years we have grown the company from 5 people to 20, raised 3 rounds of investments. The last round was with a valuation of the company at $ 5 million. We have attracted hundreds of clients from small online stores to large banks and airlines. How has studying with us influenced your future career? I learned to study, to understand different areas from economics to management, from programming to law. Even at the Academy, due to the relatively small number of students, an excellent community is created.
